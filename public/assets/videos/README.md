Video Assets
============

Place your MP4 / WEBM files for the **video-based branching story system** in this folder.

Example demo setup (referenced by the default `scenes.json`):

- `scene_1.mp4`
- `scene_2.mp4`
- `scene_3.mp4`

You can replace these with your own filenames, just make sure to update the scene JSON configuration accordingly.
